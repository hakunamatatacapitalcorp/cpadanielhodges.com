      <h1>Daniel Hodges consulting</h1>
      <p>I work with other CPA’s both here in Indiana and around the country to train them in delivering this type of proactive service to their clientele. I’ve been told I’m not a typical CPA and that may be due to my ability to relate to people and communicate better. The education of a CPA is actually as a historian so the proactive visualizing and planning service level is not comfortable or normal for typical accountants. I also have an advanced training course to help smart businessmen to do the same thing for themselves without spending all that money on professional services.</p>
