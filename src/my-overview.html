      <h1>CPA Dan Hodges Fort Wayne, Indiana</h1>
      <blockquote>by Daniel Hodges</blockquote>
      <p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm a father, CPA and serial entrepreneur who enjoys helping family-owned businesses and nonprofit organizations across the Fort Wayne region and northern Indiana to be more successful with their money management. I do this by watching the numbers and forecasting what the future may hold. This means that my clientele can plan to minimize their tax liability if thatâ€™s the goal or perhaps build capital for future growth and events. I have built an organization where our focus is on the maintenance that is often overlooked so we can consult on best business financial practices that truly make a difference in the lives of our clientele.</p>
